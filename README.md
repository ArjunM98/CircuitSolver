# CircuitSolver

This repo contains the logic required to build a command line circuit solver. The user has the ability to add a variety of resistors and voltage sources via the command line. The simulator can then solve the rest of the circuit for the remaining votlages at each node not specified by the user. 

### Parser

Textual input interface for interacting with circuit - UI. Queries backend to modify, add, print, or delete resistors/voltage sources.
